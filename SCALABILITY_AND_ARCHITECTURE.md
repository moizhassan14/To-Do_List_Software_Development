# ðŸ“ˆ Scalability & Architecture â€“ To-Do List App

This document outlines how the To-Do List application is designed to scale efficiently, support high availability, and handle background processing effectively.

---

## 1. ðŸš€ Scaling for 100K+ Users

To handle a large user base (100,000+), the application is built using scalable components:

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, containerized using Docker and deployed on cloud platforms (e.g., Railway or Render) with horizontal scaling support.
- **Frontend:** React, deployed on Vercel for automatic scaling.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas is used, supporting sharding, automatic failover, and high availability.
- **Stateless APIs:** All backend services are stateless to enable easy horizontal scaling with load balancers.

## 2. âš¡ Caching Strategy (Redis)

Redis is used to improve performance by caching:

- **User session tokens** (short-lived, to reduce DB verification)
- **Dashboard task lists** (avoids frequent MongoDB reads)
- **Rate limiting** using `express-rate-limit` with Redis as the store
- **Shared task access caching** to improve shared view speed

Redis is hosted via Redis Cloud or Railway add-ons.

## 3. ðŸ”€ Load Balancing Strategy

A load balancer (like NGINX or Railwayâ€™s built-in LB) distributes incoming requests across multiple backend instances.

- **SSL Termination**: Handled at the LB level
- **Health Checks**: Automatically detect and remove unhealthy containers
- **Auto-Scaling**: Cloud providers auto-scale containers based on CPU/memory usage

---

## 4. ðŸ§± Microservices vs Monolith Justification

The app currently uses a **monolithic architecture**, for simplicity and faster development:

- All features (Auth, Tasks, Sharing, Files) live in one codebase
- Easy to test, deploy, and debug

However, it follows a **modular folder structure**, enabling future migration to microservices, such as:

- Auth Service
- Task Management Service
- Notification Service

This hybrid approach balances maintainability now and scalability later.

## 5. ðŸ“¬ Queue System (Background Jobs)

For non-blocking background operations, a queue system is implemented:

- **Tool:** BullMQ (or similar) backed by Redis
- **Use Case:** Email reminders for upcoming task due dates
- **Worker Service:** Runs as a separate container using the same codebase or as an isolated Node.js script
- **Scheduling:** `node-cron` can be used for scheduled reminders daily/hourly

This decouples slow operations and improves API responsiveness.
